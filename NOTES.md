# Strategy and assumptions

C1 establishes contract schemas and local infrastructure. The orchestrator changed local bronze to a file:// adapter; the S3 adapter remains for Vultr. C2 isolates browser capture in a disposable Docker service with an explicit per-task allowlist. C3 keeps each phase thin and persists phase outputs in the case package while evidence remains in bronze. A recorded inference double supports tests until Vultr credentials arrive. Runtime case writes are required by the contract and are owned by the case runner; engine source changes stay in this repo.

The local Docker daemon was unavailable at task start and was started with `orb start`. A manual public register lookup checked feasibility; its URL and content must never enter engine code, tests, prompts, or fixtures. `source.discover` will search from the brief at runtime. All agent inference uses Vultr Serverless Inference; no Jev backend.
